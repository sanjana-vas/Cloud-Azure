                Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access
                to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as
                a Service vendors can help you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT
                resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

            <p>
                Platforms as a Service (PaaS) vendors remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure
                (usually hardware and operating systems), and this integration allows you to focus on the deployment and
                management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource
                procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy
                lifting involved in running your application.

            <p>
                Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors provide you with software applications that are run and managed by the
                vendor. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to third-party end-user applications.
                With a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying
                infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A
                common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to
                manage feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
