            <p>
                The journey of cloud computing can be traced back to the era of mainframes, where computing power was centralized.
                Users connected to a central mainframe using simple terminals. The mainframes handled most of the processing power,
                and the user terminals were merely interfaces to access computing resources.

            <p>
                The concept of client-server computing emerged as a step forward from mainframes. Intelligent terminals were introduced that could perform
                some level of local processing, unlike the "dumb" terminals of the mainframe era.

            <p>
                The personal computer (PC) revolution of the 1980s marked a massive shift, as individuals could now perform computing tasks locally
                without relying on centralized mainframes. This increased the accessibility and adoption of computers worldwide.

        <div class="card-body">
            <p>
                As PCs became more popular, the idea of networking them together emerged. In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, each computer could communicate
                directly with others, sharing files, resources, and processing power without a centralized server.

                The development of high-speed networks in the 1990s was another pivotal moment. Faster internet connections enabled distributed computing,
                where tasks could be divided among multiple computers for higher efficiency.

            <p>
                Cluster computing grouped multiple computers (nodes) into clusters to solve complex computational problems by pooling resources,
                improving reliability, scalability, and performance.

            <p>
                Grid computing decentralized control by connecting geographically distributed and heterogeneous resources. It allowed resource sharing
                across multiple organizations, introducing resource virtualization.
